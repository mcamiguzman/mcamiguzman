I'm Maria Camila Guzman, I'm studying systems engineering. I'm interested in learning to code on a larger scale and learning ways to run programs correctly. Today I am working on improving code creation (such as conditionals, command operation and data structures). Outside of academics, I like spending time with my family and playing sports.
